Try to maneuver the frog (with wasd) to the top of the screen without being hit by the cars or eaten by the birds chasing you. 

You can (and need to if you want to succeed) shoot the birds by clicking them and shooting projectiles in the direction of your mouse click. 

When you get to the top, hit w one more time to get 100 points and a new level.

If you find yourself in a tundra or desert biome, you must jump before the movement timer runs out (seen in the top left corner) or you will freeze or burn your feet. There are cacti and snowmen in the Desert and Tundra biomes for decoration but they will not harm you.

If it is too hard, you can disable the birds by pressing 0 and disable the movement timer by pressing t. With enough practice, it is definitely possible to play and succeed indefinitely even with these challenges enabled.

Good luck!
